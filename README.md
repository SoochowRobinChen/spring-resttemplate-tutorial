# Spring Boot RestTemplate Tutorial

This source code goes along with this [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/XtXm9BHCiZM).

This project contains two Spring Boot projects:
  - Server: A basic REST API serving book and author data loaded into an in-memory H2 database using Flyway.
  - Caller: A basic application which calls the Server application with the RestTemplate.
